This is the start of the 2nd project! From what I understood of the instructions, I have to write a program in Prolog that can solve a maze. I plan on making the maze first before I even handle solving it. I'll start on it either today or the next few days.

I won't lie, it took me a while to setup Prolog. I wanted to use it in VS Code, but I couldn't get it to work at all. So, I had no other choice but to use SWI-Prolog. It sucks because I have to manually do `make.` to compile the file everytime I want to run it after making some changes. Not only that, but the application seems too old for my liking. Anyways, I've also gotten started on `main.pl`. Everything will be wrapped around in the `find_exit/2` predicate. All I have done so far is figure out a way to find the starting position (`s`) in the maze. Next, I was thinking on adding two rules for `solve_maze`, which is the base case and recursive case. For the base case, the solver will come to an end if the current cell is `e`. If `e` is NOT the current cell, then I'll recursively move the current position to another based on the next action. Of course, I will check if the action is ok to do, just in case the move leads to a collision with a wall/floor or leaving the boundaries. That's all I have planned out for now.

I've added a way to search for an appropriate path from the starting position to the end. This is only for the first clause of `first_exit/2`, when the user doesn't include a list of actions. I'll work on the remaining stuff such as verifying the path the user gives based on their list of actions (whether or not it reaches the exit). A problem I've noticed is `display_map(M)`. It seems to display the map in "Unicode" which makes it difficult for me to truly test my code visually. It's not part of the scope of the project, yet I would love to see the maze properly, rather than it being cryptic. I plan on asking the professor on how I can fix this issue. That is all!
