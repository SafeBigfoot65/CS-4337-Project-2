# CS-4337.006-Project-2
- Name: Tobenna Nwosu
- Class: CS 4337.006
- Tool: SWI-Prolog
- Programming Language: Prolog

## Files
- `main.pl`
	- Main program file. Contains `find_exit/2` as instructed in the project.

- `example.pl`
	- Show examples of good and bad maps. Provided by the professor, but altered to make it visually readable.

- `test.pl`
	- Provided by the professor to generate the map.

## Instructions
- It's pretty simple, if you are using "SWI-Prolog", just click on `File`, then `Consult`, and drag the 3 files (`main.pl`, `example.pl`, and `test.pl`). Now that you have compiled the files, you have two options:

    1. Finding an appropiate path - this will give you a list of actions that represents what moves are needed to reach the exit. 
        - Code: `simple_map(M), display_map(M), find_exit(M, A).`
    2. Verifying Actions - If a list of actions is provided, then this will verify if performing the actions will lead to the exit
        - Code: `simple_map(M), display_map(M), find_exit(M, [right, right]).`
- As you can see in the two lines of command above, I use `simple_map(M)` as an example, but feel free to replace it with `basic_map(M)` or `basic_map2(M)` to experiment with other maps
